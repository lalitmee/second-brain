** inxi is a command line system information script built for console and IRC.
   [[https://askubuntu.com/a/1072433][Stackoverflow Link]]
** netstat
   To find the running localhost port PID(process ID):
   #+begin_src bash
   netstat -tulpn
   #+end_src

** pkill
   To kill a process by using PID(Process ID)
   #+begin_src bash
   pkill -9 <PID>
   #+end_src

** grep
*** search for some string in any file
    #+begin_src bash
    grep "some string" file
    #+end_src
*** The -i option enables us to search for a string case-insensitively in the given file. It matches words like “REACT,” “REact,” and “react.”
    #+begin_src bash
    grep -i "REact" file
    #+end_src
*** We can find the number of lines that matches the given string/pattern with the -c (count) flag.
    #+begin_src bash
    grep -c "react" index.js
    #+end_src
*** Here’s a fun and an educational comic about the grep command I found on the internet.

    find path -name filename
    #+end_src

** Rust Alternatives to Classic Command Line Tools
   | Rust Tool | Replaces / Alternative to | Key Features & Notes |
   |-----------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | *eza* | `ls` | A modern, maintained successor to `exa`. Features sensible defaults, colors, icons, and Git awareness. |
   | *bat* | `cat` | Adds syntax highlighting, Git integration, line numbers, and automatic paging while maintaining `cat` compatibility. |
   | *dust* | `du` | Provides a compact, visual representation of disk usage (tree-like) that is easier to parse at a glance. |
   | *fd* | `find` | Faster and simpler syntax than `find`. Ignores hidden files and `.gitignore` patterns by default. |
   | *ripgrep (rg)* | `grep` | Dramatically faster search with color highlighting. Respects `.gitignore` rules automatically. |
   | *procs* | `ps` | A structured, color-coded view of system processes, making it easier to read than standard `ps aux`. |
   | *tldr* | `man` | Simplified man pages focusing on practical examples and essential flags rather than exhaustive documentation. |
   | *broot* | `tree` | Interactive directory navigation. Allows you to collapse/expand folders and search, unlike the static output of `tree`. |
   | *zoxide* | `cd` | Tracks your most visited directories, allowing you to "jump" to them without typing the full path. |
   | *lsd* | `ls` | Another `ls` alternative focused on visuals, adding built-in icons and vibrant colors to directory listings. |
   | *bottom* | `top` | A graphical process monitor with real-time graphs for CPU, memory, and disk usage. |
   | *hyperfine* | `time` | A command-line benchmarking tool. Runs commands multiple times to provide statistical comparisons of execution speed. |
   | *xplr* | `nnn` | A terminal file explorer with file previews, Vim-style keybindings, and customizable layouts. |
