  Its not working correctly right now. I may want to create files on the basis
  of the day and if I add anything in the same day at any time it should add it
  in the same file and then if I add something on the next day it should create
  a new file for that day and new heading according to the time of the day
  It should be possible in org-mode, I believe.
