    It would be good I think if we can open the todos, scratch or notes from anywhere in i3, maybe we can just have one keybinding that shows up the fzf menu to select what I want to do and then opens up a nvim window

* TODO integrate git hunks :NEOVIM:TASK:
  SCHEDULED: [2025-10-24 Fri 13:27] DEADLINE: <2025-10-24 Fri>

  - there is a telescope extension for git hunks
    - this is not working correctly for me right now
  - I also have a `GitHunks` command that shows git hunks in a telescope
    picker
    - I think we can use the same logic to show git hunks in a task picker

** Git Hunks Next/Previous
   - I want to be able to jump to the next/previous git hunk in a file
   - this can be done with the `:Gitsigns next_hunk` and `:Gitsigns prev_hunk` commands
   - I want to bind these commands to keys for easy access
